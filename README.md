> Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Locate the Object Library in Xcode.
* Drag & drop a **View Controller** object onto the canvas.
* Hide and Show the Document Outline to view a breakdown of the View Controller Scene.
* Explain that a View is provided along with every **View Controller Scene**.
* Explain that a **UIView** represents the rectangular area on the screen which manages all of the content that is placed within it. It is the main way the application interacts with the user.
* Drag & drop a **Label** from the Object library onto the View.
* Drag & drop a **Button** from the Object library onto the View.
* Explain that the Attributes inspector is where they can edit attributes of the selected object. For example, changing the background color of their view.
* Change the background color of the View by selecting the View from within their storyboard file, click the Attributes inspector and change the Background color from the drop down menu.
* Select their View Controller as being the "Initial View Controller" in the Attributes Inspector 

## What the student can do at this point 

* Has a general overview of Xcode and is able to create a new project.
* Knows where to locate the testing file within Xcode.
* Knows how to navigate to Interface Builder. 
* Knows what a storyboard file is.
* Has a brief overview of what the Object Library is.
* Can drag a View Controller onto the canvas.

## Outline / Notes

* Take the student through what it is I outlined above in the Learning Objectives with screenshots and explanations.
* There's no reason to talk about Auto Layout or Size classes (yet). I've unchecked those boxes in the File Inspector in the Xcode project in this repo.
* The Xcode project is ready to go in that the storyboard file is empty. As well, the Auto Layout and Size Classes are unchecked.
